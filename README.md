# crypt
Quick and easy key-based AES encryption for files. ***Please do not use this on anything too important.*** I did this because I thought it would be fun, cool, and maybe useful for something--but not because it is super secure.

Next steps are to try to allow encryption of directories which starts a daemon to monitor for changes in the directory and live-updating the directory.

My biggest objective is to learn/play with Rust.
